= Numbers, Strings and variables

== Creating a name
* Should be descriptive (Not like x)
* Must refer to an actual thing
* Separate the problem domain from solutions domain
* Name should begin with Letters
* Create longer name
* Last part of the name should be a very broad summary of things
* put narrower & specialized prefixes

== Category of name
* Class Name
** Summarizes objects
** use capitalized camelCase
* Object
** use snake case (all lower case with lots of _ )
* Script and module file
** use letters
** (_) Characters
** End with .py

>>> target_color_rgb = target_color_name = 'firebrik'
>>> id(target_color_name) == id(target_color_rgb)
True

== Approach to creating names
* More specific qualifier => more specific category
* Example : .com => .google => mail
** mail.google.com
** service@packtpub.com
