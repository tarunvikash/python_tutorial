== Slice Notation
* Decomposing a string
* A slice has two parts (start and end)
* It is segregated by colon
* Includes the starting index
* String indices always start with 0 as the first item
* It never includes the ending Index.

== Slice type
* title[colon_position]:    # single item ":"
* title[:colon_position]:   # slice with start omitted
* title[colon_position+1:]  # slice with end omitted
* title[:]:                 # entire string

== indices that work from right side
* title[-1]:                # last character
* title[-2]:                # second character
* title[-6:]:               # sixth to last
